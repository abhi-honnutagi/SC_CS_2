# Image Encryption Using Pixel Manipulation

## Overview

This project implements an image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. The program secures an image by modifying its pixel values with mathematical operations and a user-defined secret key, making the image unreadable without the correct key.

## Objectives

To understand image data as pixel matrices

To apply basic encryption concepts to digital images

To implement reversible encryption and decryption

## Tools Used

Python

Pillow (PIL)

NumPy

## Description

Image encryption is performed by modifying pixel RGB values using a key value. The same key is used during decryption to restore the original image.

## How to Run

Place input.png in the folder

Run: python image_encrypt.py

Choose encrypt or decrypt

## Output

encrypted.png

decrypted.png
